## About Me

Greetings! I am Zaveon, an experienced software tester who has recently transitioned from manual testing to automation testing. With a passion for quality assurance and an eagerness to embrace new technologies, I have honed my skills to excel in the world of automated testing.

In my previous role as a manual tester, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of software testing methodologies, test case design, and bug reporting. I cultivated a meticulous approach to ensuring product quality and became proficient in various testing techniques, including functional, regression, and user acceptance testing.

As an automation tester, I am dedicated to continuously improving test processes and embracing emerging technologies that drive innovation in the field. My adaptability, strong problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail make me well-suited for handling complex testing challenges and delivering optimal solutions.

I am excited about this new chapter in my career, where I can leverage my testing experience while embracing the power of automation to elevate the quality of software products. I am eager to contribute my skills, enthusiasm, and determination to drive excellence in automated testing and contribute to the success of your organization.

Thanks for the read!

## Books I have read
__"Testing dot com"__ R.Savin 2017 (in Russian) - an excellent book for a very beginners. It explains the general goals and basic techniques in software testing.

Postman API Testing - Restful-booker

The API testing project using Postman involves testing the RESTful API endpoints provided by the "Restful-booker" resource. This includes creating a Postman collection of API endpoints, writing test scripts using Postman's testing framework to validate responses, and checking for errors, performance, and authentication. The Restful-booker resource provides a set of pre-built API endpoints that allow you to test and validate different aspects of a hotel booking application, such as creating and updating bookings, checking availability, and retrieving booking details.
